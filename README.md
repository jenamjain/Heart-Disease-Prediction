# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type.  
It uses a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to analyze inputs and return a prediction through a simple web interface.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit (for web interface)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy
